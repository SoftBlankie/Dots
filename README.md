# Dots
C++ simulation of AI learning through natural selection

### Goal

The goal of this program is to simulate the process for how an AI learns through natural selection. The creation of this program allows me to understand the SFML library in C++ used for graphics and games. Furthermore, allows me to understand the underlying concept for how AI learning works for preparation in understanding artificial intelligence concepts as well as its applications.

### Features

The program is written in C++ using the SFML library. The creation of this project originates from Code Bullet's dots program written in Processing.

A population of dots is generated to get from point A to point B. The concept revolves around the use of natural selection to specify the dot most likely to get to point B.

### Challenges

Since the program was originally from Processing, the gap between understanding Processing and C++ required for multiple references to implement certain features that exist within creating such a program. 

Each challenge is listed below:
pVectors
SFML for graphics
Gap in time complexity
Processing OOP - C++ OOP

### Controls

Keys:
Escape : Quit
